My Jasspa MicroEmacs Configuration
==================================

This is nothing more than my Jasspa MicroEmacs Configuration files.

Jasspa MicroEmacs is a great editor that is by no means Micro and
has nothing to do with the modern day "Emacs" nor Lisp. Give it
a try and I think you'll like it!

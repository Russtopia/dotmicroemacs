My Jasspa MicroEmacs Configuration
==================================

This is nothing more than my Jasspa MicroEmacs Configuration files.

Jasspa MicroEmacs is a great editor that is by no means Micro and
has nothing to do with the modern day "Emacs" nor Lisp. Give it
a try and I think you'll like it!

Note: As of April 2016, upstream jcowgar/dotmicroemacs maintainer stated he no longer uses microemacs, and offered to transfer his repo to me; but until I hear back from him I'll keep this fork and will maintain it focusing on golang, and possibly Lua, for my own purposes.
